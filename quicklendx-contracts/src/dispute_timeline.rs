//! Dispute timeline endpoint - normalizes dispute lifecycle events into a
//! chronologically ordered, redacted sequence suitable for UI consumption.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! On-chain dispute state is stored as a flat [`Dispute`] struct embedded in
//! each [`Invoice`].  This module reconstructs the implicit event sequence
//! (Opened -> UnderReview -> Resolved) from that struct, redacts fields that
//! must not leak to unprivileged callers (evidence, resolution text), and
//! returns a paginated [`DisputeTimeline`] value.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! - Evidence is **always** redacted from timeline entries; it is only
//!   accessible via `get_dispute_details` to authorized parties.
//! - Resolution text is redacted until the dispute reaches `Resolved` status.
//! - No PII from invoice metadata is included.
//! - Pagination bounds use saturating arithmetic to prevent overflow.
