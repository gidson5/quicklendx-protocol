//! Investment terminal state transition tests for QuickLendX protocol.
//!
//! Test suite validates allowed transitions into terminal investment statuses
//! and matching invoice side effects as required by issue #717.
//!
//! ## Terminal States Tested
//! - **Completed**: Investment successfully settled with full payment
//! - **Withdrawn**: Investment funds withdrawn by investor  
//! - **Defaulted**: Investment defaulted due to non-payment
//! - **Refunded**: Investment refunded due to invoice cancellation
//!
//! ## Coverage Matrix
//! | Test | From -> To | Invoice Impact | Events | Storage Invariants |
//! |------|-----------|----------------|--------|-------------------|
//! | test_investment_completion_flow | Active -> Completed | Paid | Settlement events | Active index cleaned |
//! | test_investment_withdrawal_flow | Active -> Withdrawn | Funded -> Cancelled | Withdrawal events | Active index cleaned |
//! | test_investment_default_flow | Active -> Defaulted | Defaulted | Default events | Active index cleaned |
//! | test_investment_refund_flow | Active -> Refunded | Refunded | Refund events | Active index cleaned |
//! | test_invalid_terminal_transitions | Terminal -> Active | Rejected | - | Error validation |
//! | test_terminal_state_immutability | Completed -> * | Rejected | - | State preservation |
//!
