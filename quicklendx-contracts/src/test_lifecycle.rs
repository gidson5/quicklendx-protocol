//! Full invoice lifecycle integration tests for the QuickLendX protocol.
//!
//! These tests cover the complete end-to-end flow with state and event
//! assertions at each step to meet integration and coverage requirements.
//!
//! ## Test suite
//!
//! - **`test_full_invoice_lifecycle`** - Full flow: business KYC -> verify business ->
//!   upload invoice -> verify invoice -> investor KYC -> verify investor -> place bid ->
//!   accept bid and fund -> settle invoice -> rating. Asserts state and token
//!   balances; uses real SAC for escrow, then settle path as in settlement tests.
//!
//! - **`test_lifecycle_escrow_token_flow`** - Same up to accept bid; then release
//!   escrow (contract -> business) and rating. Asserts real token movements for
//!   both escrow creation and release.
//!
//! - **`test_full_lifecycle_step_by_step`** - Same flow as `test_full_invoice_lifecycle`
//!   but runs each step explicitly and asserts state and events after every step
//!   (business KYC, verify business, upload invoice, verify invoice, investor KYC,
//!   verify investor, place bid, accept bid, settle, rating).
//!
//! ## Coverage matrix (requirement: assert state and events at each step)
//!
//! | Step | Action                  | test_full_invoice_lifecycle | test_lifecycle_escrow_token_flow | test_full_lifecycle_step_by_step |
